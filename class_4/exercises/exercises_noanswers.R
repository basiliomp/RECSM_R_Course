### INTRO TO R EXERCISES

# Evaluation: Add 4 to 5


# Assignment: Create an object `a` with value 3. 
# Hint: spacing does not matter.


# Print it to check the value of `a`!
# Hint: Capitalisation DOES matter.


# Use the square root function (sqrt())  over `a`

# Use the function again and assign the result to object b


# Try to evaluate an object that does not exist in your environment and see what happens.


# Make a logical test asking whether a is equal to b.


# What would you have to do to test the opposite? Is a different than b?


# What is the value of False and True ?
# Create a mathematical operation that equals 2 using logical statements.


##################################
# Getting help in R

# get help with R generally
# (same as viewing the "Help" pane in RStudio)
help.start()

# More targeted help
?sqrt			# get specific help for a function. help() if you prefer.
??sqrt			# looking for help beyond functions. help.search() also.

apropos("sq")		# it's on the tip of my tongue...

rm(a)			# remove a single object from the environment
rm(list = ls())		# remove ... remember?

# -------------------------
# Vectors and matrices in R
# -------------------------

# Create a vector using the `concatenate` operator.


# Select the second element


# What about asking how long the vector is? Use the function length()


# Any, all, and which (with vectors)
# See how these functions allow us to create logical tests from vectors.
# Create a vector (sequence from 1 to 5)


#Then, run the following code and try to understand each function at place.
a > 2			# some TRUE, some FALSE
any(a > 2)		# are any elements TRUE?
all(a > 2)		# are all elements TRUE?
which(a > 2)	# which indices are TRUE?

# From what you saw, what do you think would be the result of `any(a>5)`?


# Create a matrix `m` with 25 values, dim(5, 5) with the `matrix()` function.
# Hint: In RStudio, use tab within the brackets of a function to see 
# which arguments it is waiting for.


# Select an element (specifying two dimensions)


# just the first row


# just the second column


# Select a submatrix (a matrix within the values of `m`)


m[-2,]		# nice trick: negative numbers omit cells!

# Get rid of row four and column two.


# What are the dimensions of that martix?
dim(m)
# how many rows in m?

# how many columns in m?

# Save a new vector `l` with 5 numeric elements.


# Since its length equals that of the two dimensions of the matrix m, we can
# add them together! It is possible to add columns and rows to an existing matrix.
#Check the code below:
cbind(m,l)

# Can you add `l` to `m`as a new row? (Hint, ?rbind)

# -----------------------
# Element-wise operations (Some new information)
# -----------------------

# Most arithmetic operators are applied element-wise:
a <- 1:5		# create a vector
a + 1		# addition
a * 2		# multiplication
a / 3		# division
a - 4		# substraction
a ^ 5		# you get the idea...
a + a		# This also works on pairs of vectors!
a * a
a + 1:6		# problem: need same length

# Same for many other basic transformations
log(a)				# log function
exp(b)				# exponential function
sqrt(a + b)				# note that we can nest statements!
log((sqrt(a + b) + a) * b)	# more nesting

a <- rbind(1:5,2:6)		# same principles apply to matrices
b <- rbind(3:7,4:8)
a + b
a / b

# Logical operators (generally) work like arithmetic ones:
a > 0	# each value greater than zero?
a == b	# corresponding values equivalent?
a != b	# corresponding values not equivalent?

# -----------
# Data frames (back to practice!)
# -----------

# Build a data frame from scratch, containing three columns of data
# named "Income" (numeric), foreign (logical) and name (character).
# The data frame must have dimensions 5, 3.
# (Hint:don't forget the colon operator and concatenate.)


#Check that your new object is indeed a data.frame. What is its class?


# Print now the vector corresponding to the `foreign` variable within d


# As you can see, this vector contains a factor variable.
# If you want to do without factors, use this option:
d <- data.frame(income = 1:5,
                foreign = c(T,T,T,T,F),
                name = LETTERS[1:5],
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Print the `name` vector once again and see the difference.


# -----------
# Functions
# -----------

# Let's build a function called pctg (percentage) that takes one argument as input, 
# divides it by the total value of the vector, and then multiplies the result by 100.

function(x) { 
}

# Apply the new `pctg` function over our vector a.


# We can use functions within  functions too! 
# It is a pretty common practice when coding in R.
# Try to print the sum of all the percentage values of  `a` --they
# should add to 100 if everything worked so far!

### SECOND EXERCISE
#########################################################################################

##################################
# First some useful working tools.

# Where are we? The following function prints the current working directory,
# i. e., where R is set to work within our computer.
getwd()

#How to change the current folder (a.k.a. working directory)?
setwd("my_computer/example/example_path_file")

# Set the working directory to one level higher in your system.
# To get the file path, you can get the current working directory as we just learnt to do and
# then remove the last indication (after the last /)
setwd("my_computer/example/") #answer

#What is available here?
list.files()

# List objects in the R environment
# (same as viewing the "Workspace" panel in RStudio)
ls()
rm(list = ls()) # remove everything from the environment

##################################
# Packages

# Most of the time we use functions not included in base R for further developing our work.
# Other users bundle those functions into packages that we can download and use.

# The way to download packages is by using the following function:
install.packages("foreign") 

#Now, try you to install the package called "swirl"


# Then we have to activate the package by calling it using the library function.
# Note that quotes are not needed here, and that this function takes arguments of lenght one!
# Can you make this code work so we hace the two packages up and running?
library(c("foreign", "datasets"))


# --------------------------
# Finding built-in data sets

# Many packages have built-in data for testing and educational purposes:
data()		# lists them all
?USArrests		# get help on a data set
data(USArrests)	# load the data set
USArrests			# view the object

# What class of data object is USArrests?


#In order to save time typing, can you rename the object USArrests and call it USA?


# How many dimensions does it have?


# Could you show only the data referred to states with a Urban Population higher than 80(%)?


# Now, try to show only the data referred to states with a Urban Population higher than the average?


# ------------------------
# Elementary visualization

# R's graphics workhorse is the "plot" command. 
# Use plot() with two arguments: Murder & UrbanPop from the USA data frame.


# Adding plot title and clean up axis labels
# Search for the two dimensions of the plot and name each axis accordingly.


# You can also add text to a plot:
# Step 1: set up a "blank" plot window
plot(x = USA$Murder,
     y = USA$Assault,
     xlab = "Murder",
     ylab = "Assault",
     main = "USArrests",
     type = "n")

# Step 2: add in text
text(x = USA$Murder,
     y = USA$Assault,
     labels = rownames(USA))

# Try to do the same using the Urban population values of each state.
# This will allow us to compare 3 dimensions at the same time in a rudimentary way.
#Step 1

#Step 2


# Histograms are helpful to see the distribution and range of a single variable.
hist(USA$Murder)

# What would be the distribution of the variable UrbanPop?
# Remember that you can check and learn more about any functiona asking for `help()`.


#########################################################################################
# --- This is a chunk of code from a RECSM course ----
# Its function is building a random dataset for illustrating an example.
# Do not hesitate to use `?` or `help()` whenever you see something new.
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
I <- 100

d <- data.frame(i = 1:I)

d$X <- rnorm(n = I, mean = 4, sd = 4)

d$alpha <- 2; d$beta <- 3; sigma <- 5

d$y <- d$alpha + d$beta * d$X + rnorm(I, mean = 0, sd = sigma)
  
head(d, n = 12)

# What kind of objects are `I` and `d`, just created?

# How many dimensions do they have?

# Can you add a new variable to d called "string" which records the position of the observation
# (i) as character data? (Hint: check the function `as.character()`)


plot(d$X, d$y)

# Could you fit a liner model using the data frame d, 
# in which X is the dependent variable and y the independent one?
lm(d$X ~ d$y)

# As we have seen, the results from a statistical model are stored in a special type of data.
# Can you assign that to an object called my_lm?
my_lm <- lm(d$X ~ d$y)

# Try now to plot the residual error from the model (subsetting the object you've just created) in a histogram
hist(my_lm$residuals)

#Automatic way of generating plots for a linear model and its fit.
plot(my_lm)

#Plot the two variables involved...


# and you can add the expected values using the abline() functions.
abline(my_lm)

# Great! You have completed this introduction course to R!
# There are a lot of resources available to learn more about R.
# If you have time now, why don't you try to load the package `swirl`
# that you installed before?
# It is a package aimed at learning R from R.
