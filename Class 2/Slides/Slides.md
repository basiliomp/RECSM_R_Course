Subsetting in R
========================================================


Alright, so far we have seen vectors, matrices and data frames.

- What is subsetting?
- Is it the same for all objects?


```r
x <- sample(1:10)
x
```

```
 [1] 10  2  9  4  5  8  3  1  7  6
```

We have 10 random numbers.

Their positions are:


```
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 
10  2  9  4  5  8  3  1  7  6 
```

Subsetting in R
========================================================

If `x` is:

```
 [1] 10  2  9  4  5  8  3  1  7  6
```

what is the result of:

```r
x[c(1, 3, 8)] #Watch out for square brackets.

x[c(-1, -5)]

x[seq(1, 8, 2)]

x[NA]

x[]
```

Write it down without running it!

Subsetting in R
========================================================

Do these subsetting rules apply the same for all types of vectors?

```r
char <- letters[1:10]
lgl <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
gender <- factor(sample(c("female", "male"), 10, replace = T))
```

What about these ones?


```r
char[c(1, 1, 1)]
lgl[c(TRUE, 5, 1)]
gender[c(1:3, TRUE)]
```

Super test:

```r
super_vector <- c(char, gender, lgl)
super_vector[c(1, 11, 27)]
```

Subsetting in R
========================================================

Subsetting rules are the same for all types of vectors.

Exceptions are:

* matrices
* data fraes
* lists

Let's go through each one...

Subsetting in R
========================================================
incremental: true
If you remember correctly, matrices are a vector with rows rows and columns.


```r
x_matrix <- matrix(1:10, 5, 2) # 5 rows and 2 columns
x_matrix
```

```
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    6
[2,]    2    7
[3,]    3    8
[4,]    4    9
[5,]    5   10
```

Building on the previous examples, what wouldl be the result of this?

```r
x_matrix[c(1, 4, 6)]
```

To confuse you even more, what do you think would be the result of this?

```r
x_matrix[2:3, ]
```

Subsetting in R
========================================================

A matrix can be thought of as two things:

* A numeric vector:

```
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```

* Or a numeric vector with rows and columns

```
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    6
[2,]    2    7
[3,]    3    8
[4,]    4    9
[5,]    5   10
```

* Both things come from the same thing and can be subsetted differently!

Subsetting in R
========================================================

Now that you know.. what are the results of:

```r
x_matrix[1:5, 2]

x_matrix[, 2]

x_matrix[1, 1]

x_matrix[1:10, 2]

x_matrix[, 1:2]
```

Subsetting in R
========================================================

Now, data frame are very similar to matrices.




```r
our_df <- data.frame(letters = letters[1:10], age = sample(25:50, 10),
                     lgl = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 10, replace = T))
our_df
```

```
   letters age   lgl
1        a  45 FALSE
2        b  31 FALSE
3        c  41  TRUE
4        d  29 FALSE
5        e  46  TRUE
6        f  44  TRUE
7        g  27 FALSE
8        h  28  TRUE
9        i  42  TRUE
10       j  39 FALSE
```

* But if we remember correctly we can have different variables in a data frame.
* Data frames are like the combination of lists and matrices.
* How do we subset these?

Subsetting in R
========================================================

The same way matrices are subsetted!


```r
# First 3 rows for all columns
our_df[1:3, ]

# Only the first and 8th row for first two columns
our_df[c(1, 8), 1:2]

# The 5th column three times for the third column
our_df[c(5, 5, 5), 3]
```

What? Why is the last one a vector?

Subsetting in R
========================================================

So far we saw how to subset the same way we subset matrices.

* Data frames are lists, remember?
* They also have similar subsetting rules to lists.


```r
# We lose the data frame dimensions using this method.
our_df[["age"]]

# We get a data frame with this one.
our_df["age"] 

# We don't get a data frame here.
our_df$age
```

Subsetting in R
========================================================

Following the 'list' subsetting rules for data frames:

* Give me the positions of the 3rd, 4th and 9th element of the age variable.
* It should be a numeric vector.
* It should have no dimensions.

The result should be:

```
[1] 41 29 42
```

Subsetting in R
========================================================

Well, now that we're at it... How does it work for lists?

<div align="center">
<img src="./figures/pepper1.png" width=500 height=450>
</div>


```r
our_list <- list(data = our_df, x_matrix, gnd = gender)
```

Explanation

Subsetting in R
========================================================

<div align="center">
<img src="./figures/pepper1.png" width=500 height=450>
</div>


```r
ourlist
```

Subsetting in R
========================================================

<div align="center">
<img src="./figures/pepper2.png" width=500 height=450>
</div>


```r
ourlist[1]
```

Subsetting in R
========================================================

<div align="center">
<img src="./figures/pepper3.png" width=500 height=450>
</div>


```r
ourlist[[1]]
```


Subsetting in R
========================================================

```r

```

# How do we create variables inside data frames or matrices?

Subsetting in R
========================================================
incremental: true

What does this return?

```r
our_df[["our_variable"]]

our_df["our_variable"]

our_df$our_variable
```

* Nothing!
* We're subsetting a variable that doesn't exist

* What is missing to create this variable?

Subsetting in R
========================================================
incremental: true

Three ways of creating a variable:

```r
our_df[["our_variable"]] <- 1:10

our_df["our_variable"] <- 11:20

our_df$our_variable <- seq(1, 20, 2)
```

There's one other way of doing it... Think hard about `[]` and the `,` to divide rows and columns


```r
our_df[, "our_variable"] <- "this repeats until end"
```

Subsetting in R
========================================================
incremental: true

Add two variables to the `our_df` data frame from any of the options above.

* A logical vector the states `TRUE` for when age is above or equal to 35.
* An addition of `our_df$age` and `our_df$lgl`.

Call them whatever you want.


```r
our_df$lgl_two <- our_df$age >= 35
our_df$add <- our_df$age + our_df$lgl
```

Subsetting in R
========================================================

When whe subset we almost always don't subset like we've been doing.

* We never choose rows 1, 2 and 7, for example.
* Instead, we want things like where gender equals 'Male'.
* Or for people over ages 40.

You have all the tools to achieve this, can you tell me how to do this?

Subsetting in R
========================================================

Ok, we only want people with ages below 40 years old.

* First, we need a logical statement.


```r
age < 40
```

Everything set!

Subsetting in R
========================================================

* But `age` is not a variable out there in our environment!
* We have to call variables inside data frame as their first names


```r
our_df$age < 40
```

```
 [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```

* Only positions `c(2, 4, 7, 8, 10)` comply with the logical statement.
* We could try only subsetting these numbers.

Subsetting in R
========================================================
incremental: true


```r
our_df[c(2, 4, 7, 8, 10), ]
```

```
   letters age   lgl           our_variable lgl_two add
2        b  31 FALSE this repeats until end   FALSE  31
4        d  29 FALSE this repeats until end   FALSE  29
7        g  27 FALSE this repeats until end   FALSE  27
8        h  28  TRUE this repeats until end   FALSE  29
10       j  39 FALSE this repeats until end    TRUE  39
```

* However, this is too problematic. What if we had 2,000 rows?


```r
our_df[our_df$age < 40, ]
```

```
   letters age   lgl           our_variable lgl_two add
2        b  31 FALSE this repeats until end   FALSE  31
4        d  29 FALSE this repeats until end   FALSE  29
7        g  27 FALSE this repeats until end   FALSE  27
8        h  28  TRUE this repeats until end   FALSE  29
10       j  39 FALSE this repeats until end    TRUE  39
```

* Much better!

Subsetting in R
========================================================

We can subset pretty much anything with logical vectors.


```r
gender[gender == "female"]
lgl[lgl == TRUE]
```

Always think about the details!


```r
gender == "female" # is a logical statement
```

```
 [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE
```

We could've written:


```r
gender[c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]
```

```
[1] female female female female female female
Levels: female male
```

But that's too long.

Functions in R
========================================================

Let's move on to functions.

What are functions?

* Objects
* Commands
* Black boxes

All at the same time!

Functions in R
========================================================

For example, take the `sd` function (standard deviation).


```r
class(x)
```

```
[1] "integer"
```

```r
class(sd)
```

```
[1] "function"
```

* They're both of different classes
* What happens if you print them?

Functions in R
========================================================


```r
x
```

```
 [1] 10  2  9  4  5  8  3  1  7  6
```

```r
sd
```

```
function (x, na.rm = FALSE) 
sqrt(var(if (is.vector(x) || is.factor(x)) x else as.double(x), 
    na.rm = na.rm))
<bytecode: 0x7f84afccea78>
<environment: namespace:stats>
```

* For the vector we get its contents
* For the function we get it's source code

Functions in R
========================================================

* Functions are commands that accept something and return something


```r
sd(x)
```

returns the standard deviation of a variable

When you have questions about a function type `?function_name`

Functions in R
========================================================
incremental: true


```r
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 1)
```

* Check what `?rnorm` does.
* Use `?cor` to calculate the correlation between x and y
* Set the `method` argument to be "spearman"


```r
cor(x, y, method = "spearman")
```

```
[1] 0.73967
```
